# tills
A toy programming language built in Haskell.

Inspired by the chapter on monadic parsing in Graham Hutton's [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) and the semantics of the "While" programming language outlined in Nielson and Nielson's [Semantics with Applications: An Appetizer](http://www.springer.com/la/book/9781846286919)
